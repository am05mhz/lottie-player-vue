## Installation

Install [lottie-player-vue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lottie-player-vue):
```bash
npm install --save lottie-player-vue
```

Include in it either globally (in `main.js`) or a Vue component.
_Global_:
```js
// main.js
// ...
import TreeView from 'lottie-player-vue';

Vue.use(TreeView);
// ...
```
_Component_:
```js
// MyComponent.vue
// ...
import TreeView from 'lottie-player-vue';

export default {
	components: {
		TreeViewItem
	},
// ...
```

And then add it to your template:
```html
	<div>
		<tree-view :data="jsonSource"/>
	</div>
```

## Properties
Customisation of the tree is configured with the following properties:
| Name    | Default      | Description                                                 |
|---------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| data    | **required** | JS object to render (accepts `Object` / `String` / `Array`) |
| options | `{}`         | _documented below_                                          |

The options object contains the following properties, shown with default values below:
```js
{
	// type: Boolean
	// info: whether Strings that contain links should be clickable
	link: false,

	// type: Boolean / Number
	// info: maximum depth into the tree that should be considered when rendering. If set to false will render as many nodes as possible.
	limitRenderDepth: false

	// type: Number
	// info: the depth into the tree that should be expanded by default.
	maxDepth: 4,

	// type Boolean
	// info: whether the data should be editable
	modifiable: false,

	// type: String
	// info: the label for the root of the tree
	rootObjectKey: 'root'
}
```

## Events

| Name       | Description                                              | Params                            |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| changeData | Fired when the JSON is updated (if `modifiable="true"`) | `data`: the new value of the JSON |


## Styling

All edge nodes or 'leaves' of this tree have their type indicated with a CSS class, i.e. `tree-view-item-value-string`. The keys can also be styled with the class `tree-view-item-key`.

e.g.
```css
.tree-view-item-value-string {
	color: yellow;
}

.tree-view-item-key {
	color: red;
}
```
